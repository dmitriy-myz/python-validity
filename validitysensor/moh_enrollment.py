"""Match-on-Host (MoH) enrollment driver.

Isolated from sensor.py so the generic Sensor class stays device-agnostic.
`Sensor.enroll()` delegates here for devices whose blob sets `moh_enroll = True`
(see blobs_a2.py): instead of the DLL-style 0x68/0x6b enrollment session, MoH
devices build a template with the native feature pipeline (moh_native.py)
and store it via the raw 0x47 new_record protocol.

Three stages, each usable on its own:
    capture_frames()  — N placements → per-frame keypoints (retries captures)
    build_template()  — keypoints → 23136-byte envelope (pure)
    store_template()  — envelope → chip (0x47, no retry)
`enroll_moh()` chains them; `Sensor.enroll_moh` forwards `self` as `sensor`.

    The best len(NATIVE_WS_V30_REGIONS) frames (largest uncapped pool) are

    holds one geometrically consistent placement. Frames are ranked by the

    every healthy frame (real placements pool ~500). See dev/FRAME-QUALITY.md.

    NOTE: this is a structural APPROXIMATION of the Windows DLL, not a
    reproduction of it. The DLL (EnrollmentUpdate → commit) folds every
    placement into a persistent session accumulator, culls keypoints by
    cross-frame CONSENSUS (sub_180008ec0 coord histograms — the source of the
    per-tile survivor counts), and builds each v30 section from a frame chosen
    by a learned QUALITY regression (sub_180008980 score vs the 0x699=1689
    gate). That regression's coefficients live in a runtime ctx object and are
    not statically portable, and we have no cross-frame consensus step, so we
    substitute: distinct placement per section, ranked by detector pool size.
    The chip's voting matcher tolerates this (enroll + recognize confirmed on
    hardware), but the exact DLL section<->frame mapping was never
